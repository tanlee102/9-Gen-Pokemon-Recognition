About the Project:
Pokémon Recognition Model
This project is a machine learning model designed to recognize 1050 Pokémon spanning generations 1 to 9. It uses MobileNetV3 Large as the backbone, leveraging its efficiency and accuracy. The model is pre-trained but not yet optimized, making it a good foundation for further improvement. Training was conducted using Google Colab, providing a reproducible and accessible setup for experimentation.

Key Features:
- Recognizes Pokémon from a comprehensive dataset.
- Built with MobileNetV3 Large for a balance of speed and performance.
- Easy-to-replicate training pipeline using Google Colab.

Future Improvements:
- Fine-tuning and optimization for higher accuracy.
- Integration with user-friendly interfaces for broader applications.
